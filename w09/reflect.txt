1.	What happens if you try to put your templated functions in Data.cpp? Does your source code compile if you move all functions to Data.h? Explain.

when i put templated functions in Data.cpp, compile error was occured. readRow() and the design() was not readable. beacuse compliler can not see template and fuctions at the sametiome. 

2. Move one templated function into ws9_lab.cpp. Does it work now? Do you need to define the template function above main(), before it is used, or can you define it below main()?

when above main() and below main(), a max() function was not reandable.

3. Could you have done this lab without templates, by just overloading your functions in Data.h to accept integer and double arguments? What is the advantage of using templates?

this is possible without templates but it is can occur overriding error, Templates are typesafe. templates can make possible to the compiler can perform type checking before errors occur .

4. Are the following equivalent? template<class T>
template<typename T>

Yes, they are equivalent. they are both identify a type.
