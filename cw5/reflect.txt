1.	The operator+ returns a Fraction object. Explain why this operatoshould not return a reference to a Fraction object.
because it is the The post-fix operator.  The post-fix operator returns a copy of the current object before other changes affect them.  
2.	List the temporary objects in the tester module.
Fraction()
Fraction::max()
Fraction::min()
int Fraction::gcd()
Fraction::reduce() 
display()
isEmpty()
3.	List the simplifications that you made to your class to minimize duplication.
bool operator
BINARY OPERATORS
Post-Fix Operators
TEMPORARY OBJECTS

4.	Explain what you have learned in this workshop.
 I learned about how to mininimize dupliction in my code and duplication is not good to run a programming. 


quiz4____

2. c++ allow us to introduce or define new operators?
true
3.the +operator is an example of a binary operator?
false
4. helper function is settled out of the class and support it (member).

5.class bloat means the code that is percieved as unnecessarily long, slow, or otherwise wasteful of resources. 

6.If a function is defined as a friend function then, the private and protected data of a class can be accessed using the function.

The complier knows a given function is a friend function by the use of the keyword friend.
