1)	What is a safe empty state? Could you define another state as the safe empty state?
it's mean that my code knows that the object is not yet defined. to safe empty state i have to initialize it.

2)	Describe how you have minimized code duplication.
        I have several contructors that included one class to minimize code duplication.
 

3)	Explain why the canTravelWith(...) member function can access the pri-vate data of the object referenced in its parameter.
this constructor is class' member function and as such has access to class' data members, even those is is private data.

4)	What statement do you need to add to ensure that the strncpy(...) func-tion executes correctly?
null "\0' is needed to strncpy executes correctly.

5)	Explain what you have learned in this workshop.

I learned about how to minimize code duplication and code duplicaiton can causes an increase in software size and managing hard to the code
