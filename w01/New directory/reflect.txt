1- What do you think is the most important thing you learned in this workshop? 
   I think calculation ,casting, modulus are important things. Also, logic is important that how to make a code to get a correct result.  
2- Why must you add .005 to the value derived when calculating the GST owing? 
   because when i add .005 to the value, the result will 1.13. 1.1284 is truncated to 1.12 on a C standard compiler, such as matrix
3- What is the result of a casting operation? 
   data type is changed.
4- Why do you think you were required to use the modulus operator in this workshop? 
   because remainder make easy to calculte than another way. division and modulus make more simple code for calculte correct output.
