1. What is a namespace? Explain its purpose.
namespace can prevent collsions of name tant can occur when function and variables's names are same. 
2. Why are header files needed? Explain.
header file is convenient when programming is long and complex. header file can get the declaration of functions and i can call thes fuctions later. 
3. In the instructions above, you were directed to compile only .cpp files but not the .h files. Explain why you should never compile header files.
becuase header files do not need to complie for programming. header file is independent. this header file includes declaration of functions. 
4. Explain why you should never include .cpp files in another file. 
because functions can be compiled once at a time. if a .cpp files include another .cpp file this make an error.  
5. Explain in your own words what have you learned on this workshop.
i cam learn what is namespace, the purpose of namespace and how to use it. Also, i learned what is safe guards and why this is needed in programming.
