Please provide brief answers to the following questions in a text file named reflect.txt.

1)	In two or three sentences discuss the advantages of using an array of structs versus parallel arrays when dealing with related data 

parallel array is more difficult to handle. i have to add another array when i need another field. but if i use struct array i do not need to add another array. because in struct, i can save several arrays.   





2)	The preferred method of declaring a struct data type is in a header file. Briefly explain why. Hint: this is explained in the notes.

headerfile's code permit me to write code in one spot and edit in that spot. because headerfile code is copyed inside each c file.
