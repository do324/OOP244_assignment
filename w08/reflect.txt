1. What is the difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class?

1.Abstract base classe-  a class in which one or more methods within that class is declared but not defined 

2.concrete class - a class in which a method that exists within the class itself without any derived class's help.

2. Identify the functions that shadow functions of the same name in your solution?

ChequingAccount::display() shadows SavingsAccount::display().
ChequingAccount::credit() shadows Account::credit(). 
ChequingAccount::debit() shadows Account::debit().
ChequingAccount::monthEnd() shadows SavingsAccount::monthEnd().


3. Explain what have you learned in this workshop.

I learned about the difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class. also I learned about the use of  shadow function.

1. static binding- function to call in a class that employs inheritance is made at compile time.
dynamic binding-function to use in a virtual function table, which takes a little time, making dynamic binding slower.
2.A virtual function - a member function which is declared within base class and is re-defined by derived class.
3.An abstract class-this class contains at least one pure virtual function.  it can be declared as  a pure virtual function by using a pure specifier (= 0) in the declaration of a virtual member function in the class declaration.
